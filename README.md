# argument-validator
this program takes premises and conclusion and check validity of argument.


# Write a Python program to determine if the following argument is valid or invalid. 

The program should print out a truth table, mark critical rows, and in the end state whether the argument (form) is valid or invalid. Naturally, youâ€™ll first have to convert it into an argument form. Take note that there should be five variables.

(Premise 1) If he attracts the farm vote then he will carry the rural areas, and if he attracts the labor vote then he will carry the urban centers.

(Premise 2) If he carries both the urban centers and the rural areas then he is certain to be elected.

(Premise 3) He is not certain to be elected.

(Conclusion) Therefore, either he does not attract the farm vote or he does not attract the labor vote
